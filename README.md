# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Cognition Board UI

A web-based visual interface for rendering a tridimensional chess board with interactive piece movement, layered cognition simulation, and AI visualization.

## Features

- 🧱 Layered board rendering (Canvas or WebGL)
- ♟️ Animated piece movement across layers
- 🧠 AI cognition visualization (decision paths, drills)
- 🎮 Interactive controls and move logging
- 🌐 Web-based deployment via GitHub Pages

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas or Three.js (WebGL)
- JavaScript / React
- Python backend (optional, for engine integration)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start                                                                   src/

## 🛠️ Next Step: Rendering Scaffold

Would you like to:

- Start with a **Canvas-based layered board**?
- Jump into **Three.js for full 3D rendering**?
- Add a **move log and layer toggle UI**?

You’ve named the repo, seeded the README, and now it’s time to build cognition into the interface. Let’s begin your first visual layer.          mkdir -p public
mkdir -p src/canvas
mkdir -p src/components
mkdir -p src/engine
mkdir -p src/styles
touch src/App.js
touch index.html
touch README.md                                                              Cognition-board-ui/

An immersive visualization project designed to render dynamic cognition pulses across a board.  
This project uses **React** and **Canvas/WebGL** techniques to simulate activity, collisions, and adaptive behaviors.  
Includes a modular **DebugHUD** overlay for live stats (pulse count, collisions, FPS).
