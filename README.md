# Cognition Board UI

A web-based visual interface for rendering a tridimensional chess board with interactive piece movement, layered cognition simulation, and AI visualization.

## Features

- 🧱 Layered board rendering (Canvas or WebGL)
- ♟️ Animated piece movement across layers
- 🧠 AI cognition visualization (decision paths, drills)
- 🎮 Interactive controls and move logging
- 🌐 Web-based deployment via GitHub Pages

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas or Three.js (WebGL)
- JavaScript / React
- Python backend (optional, for engine integration)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start                                                                   src/

## 🛠️ Next Step: Rendering Scaffold

Would you like to:

- Start with a **Canvas-based layered board**?
- Jump into **Three.js for full 3D rendering**?
- Add a **move log and layer toggle UI**?

You’ve named the repo, seeded the README, and now it’s time to build cognition into the interface. Let’s begin your first visual layer.          mkdir -p public
